//  This can be more concisely written using logical assignment operator :

// rest1.numGuests ||= 10;
// rest2.numGuests ||= 10;

//Nullish operator
rest1.numGuests ??= 10;
rest2.numGuests ??= 10;

//onsole.log(rest1.numGuests, rest2.numGuests);

// logical And Assignment operator

console.log((rest1.name &&= 'Annonymous'));
console.log((rest2.name &&= 'Annonymous'));

//BAsically && logical assignment operator is used to set a value of something which is truthy
