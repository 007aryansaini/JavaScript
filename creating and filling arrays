--> We can create array dynamically : 

      --> By using fill method : 
        
              The array fill method is just like slice method we use fill method to fill the array with the element that we specify in the argument 
              and there are two other parameters that are starting index and the ending index.
'use strict';

const x = new Array(5);
x.fill(1, 1, 3);
console.log(x);


     --> By using from method : 
     
               We use from method to create array dynamically. in the first argument we have to pass an obect with the length to be specified and
               in the second argument we uses a callback function to set the values. in the callback function we get two arguments the current element
               and the index.
               
               
// using from method

const y = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => 1);
console.log(y);

const z = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => i + 1);
console.log(z);
