Problem :    


guest = 0;

//Setting the default values of guests :
const getGuest = guest || 10;

console.log(getGuest);


--> This problem is solved by using nullish coalescing operator ( ?? ) which is introduced in Es in 2020.

guest = 0;

//Setting the default values of guests :
const getGuest = guest ?? 10;

console.log(getGuest);

o/p = 0 ( as expected)

Nullish Values :  null or undefined ( NOT 0 and '')

Basically it considers 0 and '' as the truthy values.  Falsy values are ( null or undefined ).
