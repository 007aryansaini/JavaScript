--> Spread Operator : . It basically takes out all element out of the array.
                      . For eg : 
                       
                              let arr = [3, 4, 5];
                              let newSpreadArray = [1, 2, ...arr];
                              
                              o/p : [ 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5]
                              
                       . If we now use ... with newSpreadArray then we will get individual elements.
                            eg:   console.log( ...newSpreadArray);
                                 o/p : 1 2 3 4 5 
                                 
                                 
        *****#NOTE : The spread operator takes out all the elements from the array and it does not create new variables unlike destructing operator.
                     But sice ESC6 2018 we can use spread operator with OBJECTS even though arrays are not iterable.
        
        --> Two used cases of spread opeartor :
          . create shallow copies
          . merge two arrays
          
          
         . Spread operator works on all iterable literals. 
                  Iterables are :  arrays , sets , strings and maps BUT NOT Object.
                  
          #NOTE : The spread operators only works with arrays and when the passed in functions as a paramater.
