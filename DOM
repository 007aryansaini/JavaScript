                                    . DOM isautomatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads.
                                    
                              
                              
                              .Document is the entry point to the DOM.
                              
                              #NOTE: DOM is not the part of javascript. The DOM and the DOM method are actually the part of web API's.
