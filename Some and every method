The include method only returns if a certain value is present or not that is it only checks for === .
But if we want some other conditions to be satisfied then we will use some function. It will return true if at least one element is there which is 
satisfying the condition and otherwise false.

Every is used when all the elements in the array satisfies the condition else false.

They both uses callback functions as we have used in other array methods.
