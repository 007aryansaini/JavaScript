--> OR Short circuiting : . It does not necessary that the result of the or aperator shorld be boolean always. 
                                eg: -   console.log( 3 || 'Aryan' );
                                         o/p = 3
                       . Three important properties of logical operators-
                         . Use any data type. 
                         . Return any data type.
                         . short circuiting evaluation.
                         
                       . Short circuit in OR operator : if the first operand is a truthy value then it is immediately returns that truthy value
                                                        without evaluating the second value. and if the first value is a falsy value then it will evaluate
                                                        the second value and it will then be returned ( the value or the second operator ).
                                                        
                                        eg: console.log ( undefined || 0 || null || '' || 'hello' || 23 || null );
                                         o/p : 'hello'
                                         
                                         -> In the above example first is a falsy value then it will evaluate the next operand and it will continue doing that
                                            until it truthy value is encountered and in case it found it first truthy value then it will imm ediately returns
                                            this value without even further calculating the other operators.
                                             So, In this example the first truthy value is 'hello' so thats why it is returned.
                         
                         
--> AND sort circuitng :- It works in exact differnt way of OR short circuiting. It will first evaluate the first value  if the first value is a falsy
                          value then it will immediately returns that value and if the first value is truthy it will evaluate the next value if the next
                          value is falsy then it will immediately retrns that value just opposite or OR short circuiting.
                          
                          eg:  console.log( 'hello' && 23 && null || 'aryan' || undefined || '' );
                               o/p :- null as it is the first falsy value and it will immediately returns this value without evaluating the rest values.
                               
                               
                               
       ***# Note :- For practical application we can use OR short circuiting for setting deafult values and and AND short circuiting exectute the code 
                    in the seconf operant if the first operand is true.
                    
                    
                    
           There is some problem in OR short circuiting :- 
              eg:   guest = 0;

                     //Setting the default values of guests :
                    const getGuest = guest || 10;

                    console.log(getGuest);
                    
                    o/p ; 10 ( but we expect 0)
                    
                    Note : this problem is solved by using the nullish coalescing operator ( ??).
