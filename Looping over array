--> Looping over arrays :   

      . It was introduced in ES6 and that is the for of rule.
      . const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

            for (const item of arr) {
              console.log(item);
            }
      . We can use continue and break with for of loop.
      
      . If we use arr.entries() : then it will have arrays equal to arr.length and at in each array it will store the indec and the array element.
