destructing is to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure loke variable.

const arr[] = [ 2 , 3 , 4 ];

const[ a , b , c ] = arr;

we can even do nested destruction. 

const arr[] = [ 2 , 3 , [ 4 , 5 ] ;

const [a , b [ c , d ] = arr;

#Note : we can even set default values of the values like [ a = 10 , b = 10 , c = 0 ] = arr;


---> destructuring an object : 

      . To destruct an object we use curly braces.
      . here order does not matter like as an array.
      . We can only change the name of the variables by using the variable : new name.
      . We can also set default values just like as we can set in array.
      . We can also mutate these by wrapping in a parenthesis as {} in java expects a code.
