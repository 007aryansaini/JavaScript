--> Rest Pattern : . The rest pattern is just opposite of spread operator. The rest pattern is used to pack an array while the spread operator is used 
                      to unpack an array.
                   
                   . The rest pattern is on the left side if = where as the spread operator is on the right hand side of the =.
                   
                   . Eg : const arr = [1, 2, ...[3, 4, 5]];
                          console.log(arr);

                          const [a, b, ...others] =  arr;
                          console.log(a, b, others);


--> Rest pattern application in function :  
 
 
                eg:-  const add = function (...elements) {
                      let sum = 0;
                      for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
                      sum += elements[i];
                      }
                      return sum;
                      };

                      console.log(add(2, 3, 4, 5));

                    #Conclusion : In this add fucntion you can pass as many arguments as you want and in return you will get the sum of all the 
                                  arguments that you have passes in the array.
