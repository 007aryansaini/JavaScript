--> constructor function :    New operator is used to call a constructor function.
                              There are basically 4 steps when a constructor function is called - 
                                1. New {} is created
                                2. function is called, this = {}
                                3. {} is linked to prototype
                                4. function automatically returns {}.
'use strict';

const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;
};

const aryan = new Person('Aryan Saini', 2000);
console.log(aryan);
