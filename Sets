--> Sets :  . A set is a collection of unique elements.
            . Syntax : const orderedSet = new Set( iterbale ); // Iterable is passes in the set can be array or anything which is iterable
            . Set can also hold mixed data type
            
            const orderedSet = new Set(['Aryan', 'Aryan', 'Saini', 9, 9, true]);
            console.log(orderedSet);
            o/p : Set(4) { 'Aryan', 'Saini', 9, true }
            
            . Just Like arrays sets are also iterables.
            . We can also get the size of the set by setName.size;
            . We can also check if there is a certain element present in a set or not. setName.has(element ).It returns true or false.
            . Order is irrelevant here unlike array.
            . We can add new elements to the ordered sets. setNaem.add( element ).
            . We can also delete elements from the set. setName.delete( element ).
            
            #NOTE : The important use case of set is to remove duplicate elements from an array
