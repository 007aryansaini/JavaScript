It is basically used to get the element at certain index. The main benefit is that if we want to get the last element we cal also use negative indexing.
The at method also works on string.

'use strict';

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

console.log(arr.at(-1));

const str = 'aryan';
console.log(str.at(-1));
